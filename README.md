## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build an accurate predictive system that can analyze sonar signals and determine whether the object reflecting the signals is a rock or an underwater mine. This has critical applications in naval defense, maritime safety, and underwater exploration.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset comprising 208 observations, each with 60 numerical features representing sonar signals, and a target label indicating 'R' for Rock or 'M' for Mine. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (90% training, 10% testing) ensuring stratification to maintain class proportions.

## Machine Learning Model

A **Logistic Regression** model was chosen for this binary classification task due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for linearly separable or nearly linearly separable data.

## Results

The model achieved the following performance:
- **Training Data Accuracy:** Approximately 83%
- **Test Data Accuracy:** Approximately 76%

These results indicate that the model is capable of making reasonable predictions on unseen sonar data.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `numpy`: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
    * `pandas`: For data loading and manipulation.
    * `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`): For machine learning model implementation (Logistic Regression), data splitting (`train_test_split`), and evaluation metrics (`accuracy_score`).

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier.git)
    cd Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    ```
3.  **Place the dataset:** Ensure `Copy of sonar data.csv` is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook _SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-with-Python.ipynb
    ```
    You can execute the cells sequentially to see the data loading, model training, and prediction steps.

## Potential Enhancements

To further improve this project, consider:
* Experimenting with more advanced machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Performing hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search.
* Implementing k-fold cross-validation for a more robust performance evaluation.
* Exploring feature engineering or selection techniques.
* Addressing class imbalance if present in the dataset.
